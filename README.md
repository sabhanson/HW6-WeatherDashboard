# WeatherDashboard


##Description

I created this website for a user to search a specified city to access weather information. The site will save their previously searched citys in local storage for the user to access at any time. The website will display today's weather forecast, including temperature, wind speeds, humidity, and the UV index. The website will also display the following 5 days forecast, including temperature, wind speeds, and humidity.

I found the HTML and CSS process to be fairly easy, although I did not have enough time to make the JS file as complex as I would like. I have another project I need to focus on at the moment, and I will revisit this website at a later date to finish the functionality.


##Usage

The user will visit the site. Navigate to the search bar on the left side and enter their specified city. Once they click 'submit', weather information for that city will populate on the page. To search another city, the user just needs to type a different city name in the search bar and press 'submit' again. As the user makes new searches, previous searches will become buttons underneath the searchbar, for them to easily access later. The user can have as many cities saved in the local storage as they would like.
