## Description

I created this website for a user to search a specified city to access weather information. The site will save their previously searched cities in `local storage` for the user to access at any time. The website will display today's weather forecast, including temperature, wind speeds, humidity, and the UV index. The website will also display the following 5 days forecast, including temperature, wind speeds, and humidity.
